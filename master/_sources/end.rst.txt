End Connection
==============

Normal case
-----------

When the conversation is finished, the client should send a :code:`end` message over the websocket:

- **type** (`string`): :code:`end`.

Exemple:

.. code-block:: json

    {
	"type": "end"
    }

Ava will consider as error all the ws connections which are closed without :code:`end` message.


Error case
----------

For various reasons, ava can send an :code:`error` message.
In this case, you should expect that the underlying websocket connection will be closed by us after sending this error message.
